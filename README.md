# Pet Pal - CalgaryHacks 2017 project

PetPal is an application designed to help children take care of their pets by treating their interactions like a game. The child would load the game and set the name of their pet. Now, everyday the child would have to log in and say that they fed, walked, and pet the animal. As they do the actions they see the dog health meter go up and if they do all three actions in a day the dog levels up. This creates an incentive to take care of their real pet and keep it happy.
